# Apriori Algorithm

The Apriori algorithm is a widely used data mining technique designed to find frequent itemsets within large datasets. 
It works by iteratively identifying itemsets that meet a specified frequency threshold and then extending these itemsets to discover more complex patterns. 
This approach helps efficiently uncover associations and trends in transactional data.

# Association Rules

Association rules are a type of data analysis technique used to discover relationships between different items in a dataset. 
These rules help reveal interesting patterns and correlations, such as items that are frequently bought together, aiding in decision-making and strategic planning.
