# R Program for Analyzing Judgment Biases in Figure Skating

This **R program** was developed by our team for the **figure skating federation** to identify and analyze judgment biases during competitions. 
The goal is to highlight judges who consistently deviate in their evaluations, whether in specific judging criteria or in particular technical or artistic elements that may pose challenges for the judges.
The project includes **statistical analyses**, **descriptive graphs**, and detailed descriptions. **Statistical tests are employed to ensure the significance of the findings**, and the programming is designed to rigorously process and interpret judgment data. 
This program serves as a valuable tool for ensuring fairness and transparency in figure skating evaluations.
