# Program for Applying the PESTIPOP Job-Exposure Matrix to ATENA Registry Data

During my internship, I developed a program to apply the PESTIPOP job-exposure matrix to the ATENA registry data. 
The ATENA registry, established in Nouvelle-Aquitaine, collects information on congenital anomalies and associated environmental exposures, including occupational factors such as pesticide exposure.

The PESTIPOP matrix allows for a systematic assessment of professional pesticide exposure by correlating jobs with specific exposure parameters. 
My program integrates this matrix with the ATENA data, enabling a detailed evaluation of pesticide exposure reported by parents of children with congenital anomalies.

## Key Aspects of the Program:

- **Standardized Job Coding**: Implemented a standardized system for coding jobs based on international classifications, ensuring accurate categorization of occupational data.
- **Matrix Integration**: Incorporated the PESTIPOP matrix to systematically link job data with pesticide exposure parameters.
- **Descriptive Analysis**: Conducted an initial descriptive analysis of the environmental questionnaire data from the ATENA registry.

This work involved extensive reflection on the PESTIPOP tool and its context to ensure the program was appropriately adapted to the data. 
Due to the ethical considerations surrounding health data, the program cannot be run publicly and complies with the regulations set by the French National Commission on Informatics and Liberty (CNIL) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

The program demonstrates performance by providing an exposure indicator for pesticides with an accuracy approaching 70%. 
It is a valuable tool not only for this specific application but also for other job-exposure matrices. 
Additionally, this project allowed me to enhance my skills in R programming and gain insights into research within a hospital setting.
