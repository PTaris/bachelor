# Purposes of the site

Our team, driven by a passion for reading, started a project to create a website for book lovers. 
This platform allows users to catalog and reference their favorite books. 
Although the site is still a work in progress, it's a **varied project involving databases, PHP, CSS, and HTML**. 
It serves as both a resource for fellow readers and a way for us **to develop our coding skills** as we bring our love for literature and technology together.
