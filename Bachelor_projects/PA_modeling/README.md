# Hodgkin-Huxley Model Simulation

This Python program **simulates** the Hodgkin-Huxley model, which describes how action potentials are generated in neurons. By **solving the modelâ€™s differential equations**, the simulation calculates changes in membrane potential and ion channel dynamics over time. 
The results are **visualized** to illustrate how neuronal signals are propagated, offering insights into the electrical behavior of nerve cells.
