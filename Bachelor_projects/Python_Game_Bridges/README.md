# Bridges Game Simulation in Python

This Python program **simulates** the Bridges game (also known as Hashiwokakero), a puzzle game where players connect islands using bridges.
The goal is to link all the islands, ensuring each island has the exact number of bridges indicated.

The program **generates a game board from a CSV file**, displaying the islands and their numbers.
It allows players to click on islands to build bridges, manage bridge width based on the number of clicks, and ensure connections adhere to the game's rules.
Features include **visualizing** bridges, counting connected islands, and options to undo or correct moves.

This simulation provides an **interactive interface to explore the logic and strategies** behind the Bridges game.
