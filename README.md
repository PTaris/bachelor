Good morning, 

I am a student in information systems and computer technologies for health (SITIS) at the Institute of Public Health, Epidemiology, and Development (ISPED) in Bordeaux France.
In this repository, you will find all my coding projects made in a team or alone.

For any questions contact me at my university address: pauline.taris@etu.u-bordeaux.fr
