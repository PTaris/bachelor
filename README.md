Good morning, 

I am an information systems and Health IT (SITIS) student at the Bordeaux School of Public Health  (ISPED) in France.
In this repository, you will find all my coding projects made in a team or alone.

For any questions contact me at my university address: pauline.taris@etu.u-bordeaux.fr
