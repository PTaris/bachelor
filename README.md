Good morning, 

I am a student in information systems and computer technologies for health (SITIS) at the Institute of Public Health, Epidemiology and Development (ISPED) in Bordeaux France.
In this repository you will find all the coding projects made in a team or alone.

For any question contact me at my university address : pauline.taris@etu.u-bordeaux.fr
